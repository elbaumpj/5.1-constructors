# constructors
* This project consists of a series of programming exercises whose purpose was to reinforce understanding of constructors and prototypes. I also wrote constructors from scratch and added methods to prototypes in order to pass all the tests. Open the exercise.js file to see how I solved the challenges or clone the repo to get the code working locally. Happy hacking!
